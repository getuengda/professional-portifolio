## Multiverse Final Portfolio

This repo is a collection of some of my learning contribution during my 2022-2023 apprenticeship at McKinsey & Company sponsored by Multiverse.

### Table of Contents
Overview
During my time at McKinsey & Coompany, I deilvered value through improvements and added funcitonality in existing McKinsey codebases. This document is a broad overview of my contributions to the firm's services without revealing any propietary information.

Because of the sensitive nature of the Firm's codebases and the restrictions placed on us being Firm members, I will avoid using any code snippets and rely just on explanation.


### Durable Skills
The durable skills contains a README file that outlines my contributions to the firm during my apprenticeship. I have outlined my different positions I have taken on while working at The Firm at gave some insight into the skills I learned while on these assignments.


### Technical projects 
You can find my personal technical projects in the technical folder of my projects with Multiverse and McKinsey and Company, as well as on my GitHub profile, which serves as a centralized location for storing and sharing my code repositories. These projects have been developed to meet the technical criteria set by the Department of Labor (DOL), ensuring that they meet the highest standards in terms of technical quality and proficiency. By accessing my projects in these locations, you will be able to view the code and technical work that I have completed and gauge my technical capabilities.
