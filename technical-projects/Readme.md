# Technical Project

## Introduction

My technical projects showcase my skills and expertise in various technical domains. As a multiverse apprentice with McKinsey and Company, I have worked on a diverse range of projects that have helped me hone my technical abilities. These projects are designed to meet the technical criteria established by the Department of Labor (DOL), ensuring that they meet the highest standards in terms of technical proficiency and quality. In addition to my work during my apprenticeship, I also maintain a repository of personal technical projects on my GitHub profile. These projects are a testament to my passion for coding and my commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and programming languages. Whether you're a potential employer, a client, or a fellow developer, exploring my technical projects is an excellent way to gauge my technical abilities and assess my proficiency in the field.
